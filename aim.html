    <h3 id="aim">About Us</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <p>We became fascinated by the idea of bringing the legal world to the light in form of case studies, i.e. providing the facility to the students to experience the practical and situational questions related to various legal facts that they face in the textual form.
            Besides, practicing in the courts, there is a better way to understand the world of Law & Order through real life examples, so that the students learn to implement what they have understood theoretically. This will help them in being vigilant practically and theoretically about the situational outlook of the legal scenarios and gives a mental exposure about the legal acts and orders.
